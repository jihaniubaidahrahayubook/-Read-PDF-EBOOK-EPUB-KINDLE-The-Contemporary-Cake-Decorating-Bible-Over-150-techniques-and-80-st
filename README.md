Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: .0 out of 5 stars Excellent cake decorating education!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2011
Review: Please note: This book, as well as "The Contemporary Cake Decorating Bible: Over 150 Techniques and 80 Stunning Projects" are one and the same; this review is based on that book. Why the difference, I don't know.

Anyways, back to this book. Just 2 words for you............BUY IT!!! Just get out your wallet and purchase this fabulous book; you'll have no regrets as it is definitely one of my Top 10 cake decorating books. While I feel that it will probably be too simple for those already comfortable with their cake decorating skills, it is still a wonderful reference book. For those who are beginners in this field, I feel that this will give you a wonderful education and be a great support and/or reference book for you. This book is loaded with step-by-step photography of every project, as well as tools, molds, cutters, pans, etc.

It does not lack in any area of basic decorating and in fact, felt that it gives the reader some room to express their creativity with othe love of sugar. Some of the highlights for me were: the section on "Cake Carving" which can be tricky for even the experienced baker in that getting just the right angles can make quite the difference when designing a shape for a themed cake. I also found her "Color Wheel" section marvelous in introducing colors that are used in tinting creams, sugarpaste, and dusts. Her "Transferring an Image" with scriber and pen were fabulous as getting patterns onto a cake can be challenging. Her "Non-Sugarcarft Tools" was a great idea that my pea-brain hadn't thought of, in which you can use regular paper crafting items to help in the cake decorating process.

One note extra is that Lindy does have some amazing and fabulous DVD's that she has created, in particular her "Cake Jewelry" DVD, but unfortunately due to the difference in British pounds and American dollars, plus shipping, they can be quite expensive. But if you should have some extra money that you can manage to spend, go for them. They are just wonderful and and your investment will come back to you tenfold. Also, she has a terrific website so that you can purchase many of the materials and tools that she used in this book, as well as learn other hints and tips to make your experience the best it can be.

This is the outline of her book:

INTRODUCTION
This covers the prepping and planning of a cake, all sorts of pans and pan sizes, cutters, molds, how to line the baking pans, and cake recipes with batter amounts that go from 3 inch to 14 inch cakes. Cookies and cupcakes are another part of the section along with recipes for the different sugars used (sugarpaste, buttercream, etc). Covering cakes (in particular the ones with sharp corners), cupcakes, and cookies area also included, as well as stacking and transporting them when finished.

CARVING
This is one of my favorite chapters in that certain cakes like purses, topsy-turvy, and wine bottles, etc require a good plan before shaping.

COLOR
This was great in that the use of color, and how much to use, is important in order to make a shaped cake seem real, especially if you have the actual item in front of you as the example. Using the color wheel provided is an excellent way of finding contrasting, yet agreeable opposites to complement each other. The instructions for the marbling effect, stripes, checks, floral prints, and how to repeat patterns are also provided.

PAINTING
Using the paintbrush to "paint" your projects can be a daunting task but Lindy shows you how the basics are not that challenging. Stippling, sponging, color washes, metallics, and the use of embossers were demonstrated in clear photography and print. The most interesting part of this section was on tranferring an image using either scriber or pins; it takes a bit more work, but if you have a graceful or delicate image that you wish to place on a cake, the effects can be breathtaking.

STENCILING
Using this form of decorating on cakes, cookies, cupcakes, etc can be fun as well as easy and she shows you the different forms that can be used. I particularly liked her example of the cookie "flip-flop" sandals she made; very creative!

CUTTERS
Ah yes..............cutters!!! This was a fabulous section that teaches you the tools and steps needed to give you the creativity to make 3-D effects on anything by the use of cutters, molds, plungers, etc. Layering designs was the simplest of this chapter, but you will definitely need more time and patience as you learn the skills of "inlay work", "abutting", and "mosaics". If you have ever seen this type of work in churches, stain-glass windows or artwork, etc you will have an idea of how time-consuming, yet how very satisfied you will be when your project is finished.

FLOWERS

EMBOSSING
When you want to give a certain look of texture to your projects (such as make something look like fabric or perhaps have a certain feel to it, then embossing is fantastic. If you have ever worked on homemade Christmas cards or if you enjoy scrapbooking, then you know the beauty of embossing to give a project some depth or texture. Through the use of embossers, textured rolling pins, cutting wheels, etc you can have the dimension and depth a project might require.

TOOLS
There are endless tools in the cake decorating world that you can either buy or make on your own. Since it is a infinite list, this chapter gives you some basics in which you can either be very creative and make your own, or you can go to the hundreds of websites that sell them, or perhaps to your local hobby and craft store. Regardless, anything that doesn't move can be a potential decorating tool.

PIPING
The basics of piping are pretty easy for most folks. But learning the different things you can do with the piping tips as well as the mediums that can be used in the piping bag, is what this chapter is about. Regular piping, brush embroidery, and dropline work with royal icing is shown.

MOLDS (aka Moulds)
I just LOVE using molds, in particular silicone molds! The sugarpaste just pops out of them and the impressions are perfect. Using the variety of molds available, how to color them before or after, veiners, even making your own molds, are shown to you.

CAKE JEWLERY
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this chapter!! Lindy has a DVD on this subject and it's my next "wish" DVD. If you have the time or patience to make real bead and garland "jewelry" for a project, and let's say that it's for someone really special, by all means, do it. There is something about the way cake jewelry makes the cake "pop" when someone sees it; and though it's not edible. people can take it home with them and have a beautiful piece of your artwork to remember the occasion.

PROJECTS
The remainder of the book carries all the projects that were made in each section with step-by-step instruction. You will find yourself going back to the chapter for which the project was made so that you can understand what needs to be done. Cakes, shaped cakes, wedding cakes, cookies, cupcakes, and mini-cakes are part of this section.

INDEX

As I mentioned at the beginning, this will be a great source of information for those starting out in the cake decorating artform but you will need some basic comfort with cake baking to get started. But I would most sure that even those in the intermediate group of decorators, there would be wonderful hints and lessons that would be appreciated. Have fun! Thanks Lindy! Peace!

Review: Wow!!!! Any cake decorator and especially new decorators should put this book first on the list of "must have" as a valuable resource. From front to back it is filled with ideas I would never have thought of our dreamed of doing.

Lindy Smith writes her instructions in such great detail and are easy to follow. She explains the necessary tools needed to complete gum paste and numerous projects. There are also ideas on how to make embossers and many other homemade "tools." This alone will pay for the cost of her informative book. Many, many unique projects and done so beautifully done. Now, if I had a small fraction of her talent. The thing is, she makes the reader feel as if anything can be learned and mastered.

Since my area of the country is so limited on decorating classes (if at all) it puts me at the kindness of the good tutorial writers who took us tiemt o learn. So when this book come around that offered new and easy ideas and project I was like a kid in a candy store. Be ready to spend lots of time learning and enjoying your new cake decorating skills that can be carried over to your new ideas!!!!!!

I went back and forth several times trying to decide if I wanted to purchase another cake book. Quite honestly the reason it was purchased was to be eligible for the super saver shipping costs offered through Amazon. However, I did read other reviews and was convinced (thank you other reviewers) this was sure to be a good investment. And it was. Lindy and Debbie Brown are my two all time favorite authors. Any book they write will be in my library. There is always room for a few new books if anyone can share with me.

Since my area of the country is so limited on decorating classes it puts me at the mercy of the good tutorial writers. So when this book come around that offered new and easy ideas and project I was like a kid in a candy store. Be ready to spend lots of time learning and enjoying your new cake decorating skills that can be carried over to your new ideas!!!!!! Again, this book is a MUST for all you cake decorators who do not own a copy!!!!

Title: .0 out of 5 stars should be called "The Fondant Bible"
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2012
Review: I bought this book for a friend who is starting a cake business. We were disappointed that of the 160 pages, only about 30 pages didn't feature or deal with fondant decorating or some similar form of cake covering. I had previewed the contents before ordering and the word "Fondant" isn't even mentioned.
If you want to know about this form of cake covering (fondant) this book is for you. I have to say that the pictures are great, the cakes are special and the price is a bargain. Just don't exspect to find anything other then the most basic information on tradition decorating. What I'm looking for is a book that takes buttercream to an advanced level of decoration, not another chapter on basic piping. Any suggestions?
